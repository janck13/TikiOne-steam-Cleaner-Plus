# Download installer

TikiOne Steam Cleaner installer is hosted on [Releases](https://github.com/wbsdty331/TikiOne-steam-Cleaner-Plus/releases).

## Build, test and package [Thanks for Jonathan Lermitage]

TikiOne Steam Cleaner is built with [NetBeans 8](http://netbeans.org) and the latest version of Oracle JDK8.

To build the project:

* load the project with NetBeans and a Java 8 compatible JDK (I use the latest version of NetBeans and Oracle JDK8)
* dependencies should be automatically loaded from the ``./dependencies/`` folder.
* set the working directory to the "dist2" folder. It contains additional configuration files used by base application.

You can now build and run the project.

To package the application, simply merge the "dist" and "dist2" folders.

To bundle a JVM (version 8 or better), copy it into a "jre" folder in the "dist2" folder and launch the NSIS script: it will package TikiOne steam Cleaner with the provided JVM into an EXE installer based on NSIS-Unicode (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, Unicode version: I use version 2.46-5 from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/unsis/downloads/list)).
